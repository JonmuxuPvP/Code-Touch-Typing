-===[Code Touch Typing]===-
A simple web application to pratice touch typing skills with
different programming languages.

-===[App Description]===-
The app consists of two textareas, one where the user is given
a code snippet, while the other one is used to input the same
code. Once both textareas look identical, the timer will stop
and statistics will be saved within the browser with cookies.

Due to the fact that these web applications already exist, I want
to focus on certain code statements. For example, you could
practice if/else statements or for loops in different programming
languages. The user will be given pre-generated templates for these 
statements, but since there are a ton of conventions and code styles,
the user will be able to generate new templates without replacing
the default ones. In that way, as the developer, I don't need to think
of all the conventions in every single programming language: If you
want curly braces in new line, add them new line. Want to use
PascalCase, camelCase, snake_case...? Well, you name it!

Now now, the architecture of my webpage will be as the following:

HTML -> Skeleton of the main and only webpage
CSS -> Decoration and design of my app 
JavaScript -> App's Functionality, such as timers, code snippets...
PHP -> Generating cookies and possibly HTML according to different user preferences.
